# Hello (test markdown)

As this source is an md files, usual shortcodes are not supposed to be translated.

**Should preserve raw shortcode:** [hello]

**Might show shortcode converted:** [[hello]]

For simplification, twig-style could be use in .md as a workaround 

**Test twig:** {hello}

**Double twig:** {{hello}}

**Double spaced twig:** {{ hello }}
