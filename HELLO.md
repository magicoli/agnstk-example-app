# Hello (test markdown)

{{hello}}

---
The Hello block can be included in any page with the shortcode `[hello]`

In markdown sources, shortcodes are not expanded (by design), so the 
standard Laravel tags can be used instead.

---

The block title can be overidden with `[hello title="Overridden Hello title]`

{{hello title="This Custom Title" content="Custom Content"}}
